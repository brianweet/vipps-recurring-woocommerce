## Configuring products

Configuring products for use with the Vipps Recurring Payments plugin is not any different from default WooCommerce, with one exception.

The configuration for whether or not the product is virtual or physical is important to consider. 
If a product is virtual the customer will be charged immediately but if the product is physical you will have to capture the payment manually through the order in WooCommerce when you have shipped the product.

In most cases your products should be virtual when using subscriptions but it is possible to use the plugin with physical products if you need to do so.

# Extending the plugin

WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscriptions has a lot of [default actions](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/develop/action-reference/) that interact with the payment flow so there should not be any need to extend this plugin directly, 
but if you need an action or filter added to the plugin don't hesitate to create an issue on GitHub and we will look into this as soon as possible.

The plugin is currently in a pre-release phase and will have more filters, actions and features further down the road.

## Constants

Constants can be re-defined by using `define('CONSTANT_NAME', 'value');` in `wp-config.php`.

`WC_VIPPS_RECURRING_RETRY_DAYS`: (integer) default: 3

The amount of days Vipps will retry a charge for before it fails. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-recurring-api/blob/master/vipps-recurring-api.md#charge-retries).

`WC_VIPPS_RECURRING_TEST_MODE`: (boolean) default: false

Enables someone with access to Vipps developer keys to test the plugin. This is not available to regular users. See [#how-can-i-test-that-the-plugin-works-correctly](#how-can-i-test-that-the-plugin-works-correctly).

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does this plugin work alongside the Vipps for WooCommerce plugin?

Yes! You can use both plugins at the same time alongside each other.

## Do I need to have a license for WooCommerce Subscriptions in order to use this plugin?

Yes, you do.

## Does this plugin work with the WooCommerce Memberships-plugin?

WooCommerce Subscriptions and WooCommerce Memberships are able to work together for access to recurring memberships that unlock content.

**WooCommerce Subscriptions is required in order to use Vipps Recurring Payments for WooCommerce, but Memberships is not.**

You can read about how WooCommerce Subscriptions and WooCommerce Memberships work together [here](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-memberships-subscriptions-integration/).

## How can I get help if I have any issues?

For issues with the plugin you can submit an issue on GitHub or ask on the support forum on wordpress.org. For other unrelated issues you should [contact Vipps](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/contact.md).

## Where can I use Vipps?

Vipps is only available in Norway at the moment and only users who have Vipps will be able to pay with Vipps.

## How can I test that the plugin works correctly?

If you have access to the Vipps test environment you are able to use the test mode by setting the `WC_VIPPS_RECURRING_TEST_MODE` constant in `wp-config.php`. 
See the [getting started](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md) guide for details about how to get started using the test environment.

Vipps does not offer test accounts for regular users of the plugin but you can still penny-test the plugin by sending a small amount of money like 1 or 2 NOK using your production keys. 
You can then refund or cancel the purchase afterwards.

## Why do I have to capture payments for physical products manually?

This is because of the Norwegian law. You are not allowed to charge for a physical product before you ship it, without a valid reason to do so.

You can read about it [here](https://www.forbrukertilsynet.no/english/guidelines/guidelines-the-standard-sales-conditions-consumer-purchases-of-goods-the-internet#chapter-7).

If you have a valid reason to do so you can use the "Capture payment instantly" option from the "Vipps Recurring Payments" settings in your product's settings.
